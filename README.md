<h3> In todayâ€™s digital landscape, managing user accounts efficiently is crucial for organizations, and creating bulk user uploads in Active Directory using PowerShell offers a streamlined solution. This process begins with preparing a CSV file containing essential user details, such as first and last names, and usernames. Once the data is organized, an administrator can use PowerShell to import this CSV file and iterate through its entries. By automating this process, organizations can significantly reduce the time and effort required for user management, ensuring a more efficient onboarding experience while maintaining accuracy and consistency in user account creation. </h3>
